# Splunk SOC Lab: Day 8 - Creating Alerts for Detected Threats

## Overview
This repository documents Day 8 of a two-week Splunk lab series. The lab focuses on creating alerts for high/medium threat IPs detected via a threat intelligence feed, displaying them in the Triggered Alerts section (no email), and updating the "SOC Web Monitoring" dashboard. The setup uses Splunk Enterprise on Windows and a Splunk Universal Forwarder on an Ubuntu Desktop VM with Apache.

## Objectives
- Create alerts for high/medium threat IPs in Splunk, shown only in Triggered Alerts.
- Test alerts with simulated malicious traffic.
- Update the dashboard with alert status visualization.


## Prerequisites
- Splunk Enterprise installed on Windows.
- Splunk Universal Forwarder and Apache installed on Ubuntu Desktop VM.
- VirtualBox with host-only network adapter configured.
- Apache logging to `/var/log/apache2/access.log` with `sourcetype=access_combined` and updated `LogFormat` from Day 7.

## Lab Steps
1. **Create Alert (UI Only)**:
   - In Splunk > **Search & Reporting**, run:
     ```spl
     index=main sourcetype=access_combined
     | lookup threat_intel ip_address AS clientip OUTPUT threat_level, description
     | where threat_level="High" OR threat_level="Medium"
     | table _time, clientip, uri, status, threat_level, description
     ```
   - Click **Save As** > **Alert**.
   - Name: "High/Medium Threat IP Alert".
   - Description: "Alert for detecting high or medium threat IPs from threat_intel.csv in Apache logs".
   - Permissions: Shared in App (search).
   - Trigger Conditions: Number of results > 0, Trigger: Once.
   - Trigger Actions: Add to Triggered Alerts .
   - Schedule: Run every 5 minutes, Time Range: Last 15 minutes.
   - Save.

2. **Simulate Traffic to Trigger Alert**:
   - Update `simulate_xss_attack.sh` on Ubuntu VM:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     logfile="/tmp/xss_attack_log.txt"
     echo "Starting XSS simulation with malicious IPs at $(date)" > "$logfile"
     payloads=(
       "/?q=<script>alert('xss')</script>"
       "/?search=<img src=x onerror=alert('xss')>"
     )
     malicious_ips=("192.168.56.102" "10.0.0.5")
     for i in {1..50}; do
       ip=${malicious_ips[$((RANDOM % ${#malicious_ips[@]}))]}
       url="http://192.168.56.101:80${payloads[$((RANDOM % ${#payloads[@]}))]}"
       response=$(curl -s -H "X-Forwarded-For: $ip" -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "$url")
       echo "[$(date)] IP: $ip | URL: $url | Status: $response" >> "$logfile"
       sleep 0.05
     done
     echo "Simulation complete. Check $logfile for details." >> "$logfile"
     ```
   - Run: `chmod +x simulate_xss_attack.sh; ./simulate_xss_attack.sh`.
   - Replace `192.168.56.101` with your VMâ€™s actual IP.
   - Wait 5 minutes.

3. **Verify Alert**:
   - In Splunk > **Alerts**, check "High/Medium Threat IP Alert" under Triggered Alerts.
   - Note: No email should be sent.

4. **Update Dashboard**:
   - In **Dashboards** > "SOC Web Monitoring" > **Edit**:
     - Add Panel > Create New.
     - Search: `| rest /servicesNS/-/-/saved/searches | search title="High/Medium Threat IP Alert" | table title, next_scheduled_time, last_scheduled_time, triggered_count`.
     - Panel Title: "Alert Status".
     - Format: Table.
     - Save.

## Results
- Successfully created and triggered an alert for high/medium threat IPs in the Triggered Alerts section.
- Enhanced the dashboard with alert status monitoring.
